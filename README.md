# Interactive Procedural Street Modeling

Qt project for Interactive Procedural Street Modeling

This project is a C++ implementation of [this paper](http://www.peterwonka.net/Publications/pdfs/2008.SG.Chen.InteractiveProceduralStreetModeling.pdf) on procedural street generation.
It is a school project for my Complex Modelisation class.
